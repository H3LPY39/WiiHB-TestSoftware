# WiiHB-TestSoftware
An test software for homebrewed Wii's, it simply just checks out if your Wii can open HB apps so its not completly messed up. Its not some super advanced stuff, if it crashes it does not work, If you get an text it does. Done.

Also dont judge me this is the first wii software (Or real Github post) i have ever made.
I'l allway put the files in releases.
